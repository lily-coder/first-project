# Portfolio

> This is my portfolio webpage. In this section I am going to implement the mobile menu using my JavaScript knowledge to apply the following:
-When the user clicks (or taps) the hamburger button, the mobile menu appears.
-When the user clicks (or taps) the close (X) button, the mobile menu disappears.
-When the user clicks (or taps) any of the mobile menu options, the mobile menu disappears.
-When the user clicks (or taps) any of the mobile menu options, a correct part of the page is displayed.

- Below are the screenshots of my portfolio:
